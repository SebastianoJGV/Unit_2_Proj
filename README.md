# Unit 2 Project: Multi-Sensor Counter

## Criteria A: PLanning

### Problem Definition
The client is an old Japanese man who does not know Roman numerals as he has lived in the country-side all his life. He would like a multisensor counter from 0 to 9 that would allow the user to count up and down from a set start.

### Rationale for Proposed Solution
For the counter, we will be using an Arduino as, according to researchgate, it does not need external programming, it is open source, and inexpensive. In addition, since we are making a clock, we need to attach parts which is simple using an Arduino. We are attaching a servo to the Arduino to imitate the turnings of a clock. Furthermore, we are attaching a buzzer to play a sound when the alarm goes off. Along with Arduino, we will be using the language C as, according to C-sharp-corner, it is not only powerful but also a very structured language.

### Success Criteria
1. The clock should be functioning and display the appropriate time
2. The alarm should buzz a sound when it goes off
3. Japanese Kanji should be displayed
4. 

### Design statement
We will design and make a digital clock for a client who can only read and understand numbers in Japanese Kanji which will be displayed using an 8x8 matrix. An additional component will be designed to accomodate the blind and deaf which will be in the form of a buzzer that will buzz the amount of time it is currently which the client can tell by touching the buzzer and feeling its vibrations. This clock will be constructed using tinkercad and the arduino ide and will take 6 weeks to make and be evaluated according to the criteria set above.
